# STA-663-Final-Project

In this repo, we followed and implemented the "Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo" algorithm, which was proposed by Tianqi Chen, Emily B. Fox and Carlos Guestrin (2014), where:

- SGHMC contians the required files for the package
- Comparison conatians the code for the Comparative Analysis with Competing Algorithms
- Final-Report contains the report and required figures in both `ipynb` and `pdf` files

More details can be found in our report and `README.md` in SGHMC folder
